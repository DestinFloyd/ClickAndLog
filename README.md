# Project2

Objective: Build a full stack App with Node/Express and Mongo/Mongoose from the ground up yourself.
==========

For My App I made 'Click & Log' a place to Create forms, complete forms, & log forms all in one easy location!
I have build Models, Users, which have Boards, and boards have tasks. Also Logs which have Inputs of when and what was completed.
